            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                This website started as a project to help me find board games in 
                the libraries of Kensigton and Chelsea London and share with friends 
                the amazing titles that are available.
                <br><br>
                The official catalogue is available at <a href="https://libraries.rbkc.gov.uk/"></a>. 
                The data used in this website was extracted from this catalogue with 
                a simple serach by "board game".
                <br><br>
                While the idea was floating in my ehad for a while, the 
                <a href="https://github.com/LibrariesHacked">LibrariesHacked</a> 
                project inspired me to put it to the public test. Give them a visit!
            </p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Index table:</strong> Sort board games by any title, year, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Navbar?:</strong> Clearly the website is mostly the table for now.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Roadmap</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>BGG integration in index table:</strong> An application 
                    is ongoing to access the 
                    <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/using_the_xml_api">BGG XML API</a>. 
                    Once approved expect BGG rank and cathegories.</li>
                <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> Add filtering options to the index 
                    table (cathegories, age range) - depends on above...</li>
                <li><strong>More libraries?</strong> Surely more libraries around 
                    have board games collections... shoot me a message if you know 
                    of any!</li>
                <li><strong>A map!</strong> All fun websites need a map... maybe 
                    with the libraries locations?</li>
            </ul>
